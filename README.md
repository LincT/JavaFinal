After pulling this project from github, next steps to run as follows:
in terminal run "gradlew runclient"

If all is as it should be, you'll start a special development version of Minecraft. 
(it may take a moment as there's a bit going on behind the scenes)

You'll want to go to "single player",
click on the file called "new world"
click on "play selected world"

once the game world loads, you'll see hopefully really nice blocks, otherwise if the code is incomplete you'll
see blocks colored black and purple, absolute eyesore, but at least they are there.

to see the custom additions that are a result of the code, do the following:
type "gamemode c" to go into creative mode if you're not there already
if you're in creative mode, when you press "e" on your keyboard, you'll see a lot of blocks.
if you're not in creative you'll see a lovely picture of yourself, and probably no blocks in your
inventory (TODO Author should include screenshots)
